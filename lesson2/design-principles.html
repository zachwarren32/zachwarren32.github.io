        <h2>Fitt's Law</h2>
        <h3>Youtube</h3>

        <p>
          The youtube website is a perfect example of Fitt's Law. On the
          website, it is easy to see the videos as they are big and take up much
          of the website. They even allow you to not only select the video by
          it's preview image, but by title or even by the author to see their
          other videos. Youtube wants it's visitors to watch their videos in
          order to generate ad revenue, so they make it easy for someone to
          select a video from their homepage and start watching.

        <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
        <h3>Taco Bell</h3>
        <p>

        <p>
          Taco Bell has a history of pushing certain products that they want to
          sell. Their website made it very clear how they make use of visual
          hierarchy to push those products. Here we can see that they would like
          us to try their Loaded Nacho Taco. They make it colorful, it takes up
          three quarters of the screen, and right below the big text is a white
          order now box. This is the first thing that customers will see on the
          website, in an effort to draw their attention to the item and
          hopefully persuade the customer to make an order.

        <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
        <h3>Mountain Dew</h3>
        <p>

        <p>
          The Mountain Dew website is full of color like green, red, gray, and
          lime. More noticeable, however, is their use of the rule of thirds.
          They advertise most of their beverages on the website with visually
          pleasing photos, like the one above. You'll notice that the beverage
          itself is slightly off center and to the right. This makes it stand
          out more. They also place the logo slightly up and to the right along
          with a catchy phrase "Stories. News. World" on the top third of the
          photo. All of their photos make use of space similarly with the
          Mountain Dew Sodas not being directly placed in the center and good
          use of the horizontal and vertical lines that create the rule of
          thirds.
